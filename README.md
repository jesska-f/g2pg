# g2pg
g2pg takes a Google Sheet, converts it to a DataFrame, which you can then manipulate as you need to.
This DataFrame can then be written to a PostgreSQL database table.
This makes use of a `.env` file, which after much trial and error I finally got to work with gspread.

### How does it work
g2pg uses the `gspread` package to extract data from the Google Sheet. 
Follow these directions to get the json credentials file that can  be used with `gspread` <https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-bots-using-service-account>
The json credentials need to be stored in a `.env` file. Don't upload the contents of your .env or json_credentials file to github unless you want everyone to know your secrets.

If using this package you need to have a `.env` file or enviroment variables set in the following way.

    DB_USER= 'username'
    DB_PW = 'super_secret_password'
    DB_URL = 'db_address'
    DB_NAME = 'db_name'

    SHEET_TYPE= 'service_account'
    SHEET_PROJECT_ID= 'api-project-XXX'
    SHEET_PRIVATE_KEY_ID= '2cd … ba4'
    SHEET_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw … jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    SHEET_CLIENT_EMAIL= 'yoursisdifferent@developer.gserviceaccount.com'
    SHEET_CLIENT_ID= '1234567890'
    SHEET_AUTH_URI= 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth'
    SHEET_TOKEN_URI= 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'
    SHEET_AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL= 'https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs'
    SHEET_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL= 'https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/bla...bla..bla.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

There are 2 methods available:
* `def get_df_from_gsheet(gsheet_name,worksheet_name)`
    This returns a datframe from the specified Google Sheet and worksheet.The worksheet name is optional and will default to `Sheet1`.
    The dataframe will have all columns and rows removed, where there is no data, and the column names will be converted to a database friendly format.
* `def df_to_db(df, table_name,schema, index_name)`
    This writes the specified `df` to the `table_name` in the DB that is specified in the `.env` file.
    `schema` is optional and will default to `public` in postgres if not specified.
    `index_name` is the index of your df. If not specified, it will default to index (this is used as the primary key in your DB table).

To use (Was not winning getting this to work in a human friendly way)
`from g2pg.g2pg import get_df_from_gsheet`
and
`from g2pg.g2pg import df_to_db`
